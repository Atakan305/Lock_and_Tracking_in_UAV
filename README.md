# Lock_and_Tracking_in_UAV

As a team, we competed in Teknofest, Turkey's most comprehensive technology and competition festival.
I worked for 2 years in that team and led the software department.
One of these projects contain the codes for locking on a target which is another UAV in the sky. 
Another one is about trajectory tracking in line with the task given in the competition during the flight of our UAV-UCAV teams. 

The codes include; giving commands to our plane such as arm, disarm, set; and using frames such as LocationGlobalRelative. 

the plane was attached to MissionPlanner and the simulations were done from there. 
Accordingly, the codes are; after the configuration of the aircraft was done in MP, it was run.
According to the commands given in the code, the plane could take off,
land at the determined coordinates and stay in the air at the parameters we wanted.

# Lock_and_Tracking_in_UAV

As a team, we competed in Teknofest, Turkey's most comprehensive technology and competition festival.
I worked for 2 years in that team and led the software department.
One of these projects contain the codes for locking on a target which is another UAV in the sky. 
Another one is about trajectory tracking in line with the task given in the competition during the flight of our UAV-UCAV teams.
